"December 19, 2019 at 11:24AM",@afrendeiro,Our new method (scifi-RNA-seq) uses a mixture of plate-based combinatorial and droplet-based fluidic indexing to achieve an unprecedented balance of ease-of-use and throughput in a single experiment.,http://twitter.com/afrendeiro/status/1207607526440800257
"December 19, 2019 at 11:24AM",@afrendeiro,"In droplet-based devices, generation of successful events requires a single bead and a single cell to be packaged in a droplet - each can be see as a Poisson process. To assure each droplet has only one of each, the rates of both must be tightly controlled. https://t.co/r9ETlD2XES",http://twitter.com/afrendeiro/status/1207607532325392384
"December 19, 2019 at 11:24AM",@afrendeiro,"Due to the usage of deformable beads in some platforms, bead loading is fairly efficient, so we postulated that it would be possible to use the full potential of the device if we would pre-label nuclei using the combinatorial indexing approach and load the device much more.",http://twitter.com/afrendeiro/status/1207607534112002054

"December 19, 2019 at 11:24AM",@afrendeiro,"In a simple but elegant experiment, @PaulDatlinger  loaded the 10x Chromium device (no lysis buffer) with up to 100 times more nuclei (1.5 million) and counted the number of nuclei in each droplet under the microscope. https://t.co/MnWdWBZLqL",http://twitter.com/afrendeiro/status/1207607542521716737
"December 19, 2019 at 11:24AM",@afrendeiro,By probabilistic modeling of the observed distributions of nuclei per droplet we were able to assess the linear range of the device and make predictions on the fraction of expected collisions with and without pre-labeling of cells.
